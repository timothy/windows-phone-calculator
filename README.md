# windows-phone-calculator

## Synopsis

This is a windows phone calculator. I originally wrote this to be a simple calculator thinking I would have time to go back and add more functionality. As of now I have I only finished the basic functionality and as of now this does not support order of operations. It is a pretty cool app though and I did have fun making it!

## Motivation

I wanted to apply what I had learned about Windows Phone. 

## Tests

No tests yet except basic in app tests.
